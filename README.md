# Making a map plot (1)

Tangsel, 05/09/2020  
So I was having a rigorous week analyzing some data and preparing relevant viz. One of the highest points, despite the tiredness, etc, etc, is of course, as usual, looking at the end product. Now, I won't say that it's the best out there, but it's definitely a personal achievement. I started making maps with R last year, and it was so tiring, I couldn't get back to it for months to hone the final result (didn't need to as well at that time). But I was able to do more early this year, and made even more adjustments this week for another task at work. 

But anyways, I just wanted to document some of the interesting things I do, and this is a fun post to start with. Let's see if I can be more productive in using this page :)

Cheers,
